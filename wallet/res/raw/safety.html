		<p><b>Important safety notes:</b></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Litecoins are stored on the device.
				<b>If you lose it, you'll lose your Litecoins.</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				This means you need to <b>back up your wallet</b>!
				Use the in-app backup facility for this, rather than a third party backup app.
				Keep your backup safe and remember the password.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Before uninstalling</b> (or clearing app data/wiping your device), <b>transfer your Litecoins to another wallet</b>.
				Remaining Litecoins will be lost.
			</li> 
			<li>
				<b>Payments are irreversible</b>.
				If you send your Litecoins into the void, there is almost no way to get them back.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Keep your mobile device safe!</b>
				Do not root your device.
				Do only install apps you fully trust.
				Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.
