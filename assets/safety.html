		<p>Some words about safety of your Bitcoins:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bitcoins in Bitcoin Wallet are stored on the device. <b>If you lose your device, you'll lose your Bitcoins.</b> Just like money in your physical wallet.</li>
			<li>Before <b>uninstalling Bitcoin Wallet</b> (or wiping your device), transfer your Bitcoins to another wallet. Any Bitcoins remaining will be lost.</li> 
			<li>Before upgrading Bitcoin Wallet, always consult the release notes in Android Market first! Never activate auto-upgrade.</li>
			<li><b>Transactions cannot be undone</b>. If you send your Bitcoins into the void, there is no way to get them back unless you know the receiver and he/she is willing to send them back.</li>
			<li><b>Keep your Android device safe!</b> Do only install apps you fully trust. Malicious apps could be trying to steal your wallet.</li>
			<li>Keep the risk low! <b>Only use Android Wallet with small amounts</b> for day use, and keep the rest of your Bitcoins at a safer place.</li>
			<li>If you just want to try Bitcoin without risk (but without the ability to actually pay for something), consider using Bitcoin Wallet for Testnet.</li>
