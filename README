KNOWN ISSUES

If app repeatedly force closes upon start after updating to new version, make sure to clear app
data in application manager. This is caused by incompatible class changes in BitCoinJ. Your
wallet will be lost!

When run for the first time, the block chain needs to be downloaded. For testnet, this currently
takes around 5-10 minutes on a WLAN. When the sync icon in the status disappears, the download is
finished and the wallet is on the top of the block chain.

No NFC support, because I still have no NFC-capable phone. If you can spare one (e.g. a Nexus S),
send it over and I'll send it back once NFC is implemented.
