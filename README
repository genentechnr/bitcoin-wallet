KNOWN ISSUES

When run for the first time, the block chain needs to be downloaded. For testnet, this currently
takes around 5-10 minutes on a WLAN. When the sync icon in the status disappears, the download is
finished and the wallet is on the top of the block chain.

Sometimes you will get system notifications about the same incoming Bitcoins multiple times. You
still get the coins only once.

SETTING UP FOR DEVELOPMENT

Make sure you've got Eclipse 3.6 (Helios) with ADT 12 installed.

I also have Subclipse (http://subclipse.tigris.org/) installed, but you can probably use
Subversive as well. 

Use File -> Import -> Checkout Projects from SVN

Repository location: http://bitcoin-wallet.googlecode.com/svn

Select 'trunk' to check out.

Checkout can take some minutes, because it contains some quite large binary files. Look at the
SVN Console to see the progress.

I had to Project -> Clean afterwards.

If you see loads of "should be tagged with @Override" errors, set

    Project -> Properties -> Java Compiler -> Errors/Warnings -> Annotations ->
    Missing @Override annotation to 'Warning'

If you are going to deploy to a device, I suggest to delete either blockchain-snapshot.jpg or
blockchain-snapshot-testnet.jpg from the assets directory (depending on if you want to deploy
testnet or prodnet).


NFC (Near field communication)

Bitcoin Wallet supports reading Bitcoin requests via NFC, either from a passive NFC tag or from
another NFC capable Android device that is requesting coins.

For this to work, just enable NFC in your phone and hold your phone to the tag or device (with
the "Request coins" dialog open). The "Send coins" dialog will open with fields populated.

Instructions for preparing an NFC tag with your address:

- We have successfully tested this NFC tag writer:
  https://market.android.com/details?id=com.nxp.nfc.tagwriter
  Other writers should work as well, let us know if you succeed.

- Some tags have less than 50 bytes capacity, those won't work. 1 KB tags recommended.

- The tag needs to contain a Bitcoin URI. You can construct one with the "Request coins" dialog,
  then share with messaging or email. You can also construct the URI by hand. Example for Prodnet:
  bitcoin:1G2Y2jP5YFZ5RGk2PXaeWwbeA5y1ZtFhoL

- The type of the message needs to be URI or URL (not Text).

- If you put your tag at a public place, don't forget to enable write protect. Otherwise, someone
  could overwrite the tag with his own Bitcoin address.
